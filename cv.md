## About me:<br>
I am currently working as Power Platform developer for 4 years. Mostly my work is connected to developing low-code solutions using Power platform. I often face situations, where our team need to come up with a workaround or performance improvements, so it helps me to train non standart and logical thinking. <br>
As well his job is giving me a lot of opportunities to improve myself as speaker and mentor, such as leading knowledge transfer sessions.<br>
I am always willing to learn something new, and that's one of the reasons why i'd like to join RS School.
